# whiskey-drop-exercise

Whiskey Drop is a code-along exercise for Code Institute's Full-stack development course, module "User Centric Frontend Development". The exercise is to practice using Bootstrap library to build the website fast, easy, and responsive to different screen sizes. 
I approached this exercise by writing my own codes first to replicate the website before looking at the solution codes and the code-along videos from the course.
One interesting thing I learned from this exercise is how to create opaque background image without affecting its children elements by creating a pseudo opaque layer using ::before.
